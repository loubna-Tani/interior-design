# lifestyle and interior design 

2020 has been a tough year for everybody. So, I created this website to share good vibes and my paSSion about lifestyle with a collection of easy recipes, accessible home design, travel, conscious living and cruelty free beauty. 
Itâ€™s a nod to the growing consensus that living simply and purposefully is more sustainable not only for the environment, but for our own happiness and well-being, too.
